"""A tool for drawing with geometry in the viewport."""

The Hpaint SOP is a viewport drawing utility, for representing 'painted' strokes as UVed geometry. Hpaint masks your strokes to the input geometry, as well as conforming strokes to the normal geometry of underlying faces.

== Hpaint Viewer State Keys == (keys)

:task: Draw strokes:
    ((LMB))

:task: Erase strokes:
    ((Ctrl + LMB))

:task: Delete full strokes:
    ((Ctrl + Shift + LMB))

:task: Change the brush radius:
    ((Shift + LMB))

:task: Clear the current stroke buffer:
    ((Shift + C))

:task: Save the current stroke buffer to disk:
    ((Shift + S))

:task: Toggle guide geo visibility:
    ((G))

:task: Toggle screen draw mode:
    ((Shift + D))

:task: Shift stroke surface distance down:
    (([))

:task: Shift stroke surface distance up:
    ((]))

:task: Toggle action by group:
    ((A))


== Recorded attributes ==

Hpaint will record almost all of the attributes provided by the [Stroke SOP|Node:sop/stroke], with some added extras.

Point:
    `arclen`:
        The length of the initial stroke line.

Prim:
    `seg_id`:
        The primitive segment number within the current stroke.

    `stroke_id`:
        The stroke ID counted within the current Hpaint SOP.

=== Stroke Utilities ===

Clear Stroke Buffer:
    Removes all strokes currently held in the stroke buffer.

Save Buffer to Disk:
    Saves all strokes currently held in the stroke buffer to the file path specified.

    WARNING:
        Saving the buffer to disk will not overwrite the currently loaded disk file, but will merge into it.

File Path:
    The path on disk to save to.

    TIP:
        Use frame-evaluating expressions such as `$F` to create frame-by-frame animations!

        :box:
            #display: rounded green

            Combine this with the timeshift SOP and template flag to give yourself basic onion-skinning functionality.

        :box:
            #display: rounded green

            For simple expression functionality, name your expressions with their associated name (e.g Eye_open).

            Link your file name to an Ordered Menu parameter, and key between your expressions for a Toonboom-esque method!

Clear Stroke File:
    Pressing [Icon:PARTS/delete_x] clears the specified buffer disk file of all strokes, but does not delete the file itself.

Swap Disk File into Buffer:
    Swaps strokes from the specified disk file into the stroke buffer, clearing the original disk file.

    TIP:
        Swapping the disk file into the buffer allows you to erase unwanted strokes from a cache on disk, and then save it back again using Save Buffer to Disk.

Action By Group:
    Enables unix-style pattern matching for Houdini groups on `Clear Stroke Buffer`, `Swap Disk File into Buffer` and `Clear Stroke File`. For example, typing `l*` and clearing the stroke buffer would clear all strokes that have houdini groups starting with l.

=== Stroke Settings ===

Stroke Colour:
    Used to control the `Cd` and `Alpha` of resulting strokes.

Stroke Radius:
    Used to control the width of resulting strokes.

Stroke Surface Distance:
    Used to control the distance of resulting strokes from the surface of the input geometry.

Stroke Texture:
    If enabled, used to specify the shader texture applied to all visible strokes.

Stroke Group:
    If enabled, used to specify the prim group of resulting strokes.

=== Tool Settings ===

Enable Screen Draw:
    Toggles the drawable object from the input geometry to a grid in camera space.

ScDraw Camera:
    The camera to draw and create a grid from.

ScDraw Distance:
    The distance of the camera grid, from the selected camera.

Enable Stroke Pressure:
    Determines if tablet pressure is used in resulting strokes' construction.

Enable Pressure Width:
    Determines if tablet pressure is used in calculating resulting strokes' width.

Enable Pressure Alpha:
    Determines if tablet pressure is used in calculating resulting strokes' alpha.

Stroke Subdivs:
    Used to control the level of subdivision applied to resulting strokes.

=== Anim Settings ===

Display Nearest Frame:
    Used to toggle how a time-dependent stroke cache is displayed. Using `Nearest Method`, snap an animation to either its' last valid frame, or next valid frame.

Ghost if Empty Frame:
    If the underlying file cache is currently visible as the last or next frame, but does not match the current frame, a ghosting effect (multiplication of `Alpha`) is applied.
